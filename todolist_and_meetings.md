###Weekly Goals
#### General
- [ ] Python tutorials!
- [ ] Git

####Simon and Alan

  - [ ] correct gaps so that each restriction enzyme site refers to a column in the aligned sequence
  - [ ] write a general script

####Maxim and Imogen
- [ ] realign .fasta output in Jalview, upload the file
- [ ] script to find restriction enzymes sites to distinguish two species
