# Notes on preparing your report


## Introduction
Introduce the biology. short paragraph on your species. Describe the structure of the mitochndrion and which parts are more variable. 
Describe the technique of RFLP and the experimental plan. 

## Materials and methods
* Cite references for software
* include a link to a specific git commit for your code
* describe each step in its own section. e.g. 'Location of restriction sites', 'Identification of unique sites'...
* Describes how it was done but not irrelevant detail (such as file names). Include any non-default parameters
* Database accession numbers *must* be cited
* Annotate all code in your own branch

## Results
Results do tell a story and may have some discussion and narrative blended. It should describe what (not how) was done, the reults obtained and why that led on to the next step.

## Discussion
Pulls together the whole experiment and sets in in context with the broader literature. 
Can you find similar work in your, or related, species. Alternative approaches that could have been tried but weren't

## Conclusion
Successful? Suggestions for improvement in the method/approach?

## Figures and tables
* These should be clear, no chartjunk.
* Sufficient but not excessive.
* Fully captioned and numbered.
